                <h4>1. Description of opportunity:</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Fr.MCM CCTV Security, Ltd. was awarded a contract by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to develop and install an Underwater CCTV camera in one of the most spectacular marine wilderness areas on Earth, Palmyra Atoll.  This island is a subject of development as a center for scientific study about global climate change, coral reefs, marine restoration and invasive species through which promises to inform conservation strategies for island ecosystems throughout the Pacific and around the world.  </p><br>
                <p>The development of underwater CCTV will be a spotlight for the company as this challenges them to produce a world class product using a state of the art communication devices, self sustained apparatus that provide a real time feed on activity on the reef thru an uplink to the central server and transmit images all around the world, thus provides Fr.MCM CCTV Security, Ltd. a platform for global recognition.</p><br><br>
                 <h4>2. Description of the objective of the project:</h4>
                <br>
                <p>The Underwater CCTV Development & Installation Project is an innovative tool to gather information about underwater wildlife.  It is a submersible device encased in a state of the art camera housing, fully self-efficient using solar power and communications solutions for remote locations.</p><br>
                <p>The Underwater CCTV will be installed in the National Wildlife Refuge in Palmyra Atoll located approximately 1000 Miles south of Hawaiian Islands.  It is designed for its ruggedness and high-security features so it can be installed in remote, unoccupied sites if so desired.  With at least two cameras with pan/tilt/zoom capability for remote operation, the system is required to deliver a streaming video feed via satellite from Palmyra Atoll to the internet.  To be deployed in a near shore coral reef environment no more than 300 meters from the transmission system, it is required to be autonomous and fully powered by solar energy and complies with NAICS code 334310.</p><br>
                <p>Designed to be secured, the software should be running in a fast and stable server.   Access to the system shall be controlled through the use of user IDs and passwords which are administered by the departmentâ€™s Lead Research Scientist.</p><br>
