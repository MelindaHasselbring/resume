                 <h4>Definition:</h4>
                 <div>
                
                     <p>work breakdown structure (WBS) is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. PMBOK defines the work breakdown structure as a "deliverable oriented hierarchical decomposition of the work to be executed by the project team." The work breakdown structure visually defines the scope into manageable chunks that a project team can understand, as each level of the work breakdown structure provides further definition and detail.</p>

                  <br>
                <h4>It's importance:</h4>

                  <ol>
                    <li>WBS forces the team to create detailed steps.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Helps to accurately and specifically define and organize the scope of the project.</li>
                        <li>Allows to double check the deliverables specifics with the stakeholders and make sure there is no missing or overlapping</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>WBS lays the groundwork for schedule and budget</li>
                    <li>WBS creates accountability</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Helps assigning responsibilities, resource allocation, monitoring and controlling the  project
</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>WBS creation breeds commitment.</li>

                <br>
                <h4>4. What is a Gantt Chart and why is it important?  How does it differ from a WBS?</h4><br>
                 <h4>Gantt Chart Definition:</h4>
                 <p>A Gantt Chart is a horizontal bar chart of schedule information where activities are listed on the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown as horizontal bars placed according to start and finish dates and is used for production control.</p>
                 <h4>Why:</h4>
                 <div id="ans">
                     <ol>
                         <li>Useful for planning and scheduling projects</li>
                         <li>Help assess how long a project would take, determine the resources needed, and plan orders in which you’ll complete the task.</li>
                         <li>For managing dependencies between task.</li>
                     </ol>
                 </div>
                 <br>
                 <h4>Gantt Chart vs. WBS:</h4><br>
                     <div id="ans">A <strong>WBS </strong> is a time independent decomposition of the work required to complete a project. It is a hierarchical structure showing a logical structure of how the work in the project is organized. It has no time element - it is simply a logical way of viewing how the work is organized. It will typically use the principle of functional decomposition to break down higher-level functionality or tasks into lower-level functionality or tasks that are required to support it.</div>
                     <br>
                     <div id="ans">A <strong>Gantt chart</strong>  is the output of WBS, it shows a sequential view of how the work is planned to be completed over a period of time including showing dependencies among items that must be completed in sequence. The items in the Gantt chart might be organized the same way that the WBS is structured but that is not necessarily the case. The importance of a Gantt chart is to show a timeline and the planned sequence of activities.</div><br>
